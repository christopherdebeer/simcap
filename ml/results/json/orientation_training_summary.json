  "conclusions": [
    "Orientation does NOT help - sensor-frame residual alone achieves 97.8%",
    "World-frame transform HURTS accuracy significantly (52% vs 98%)",

    "Real data collection is the only path to improved coverage",
    "Pre-calibrated residual fields available but provide no advantage"

  "recommendations": [
    "Use simple 3-feature sensor-frame residual (mx-bx, my-by, mz-bz)",
    "Abandon synthetic data generation - too inaccurate",
    "Collect real data for remaining 22 finger combinations",
    "Focus on adjacent finger pairs first (easier to perform)"
