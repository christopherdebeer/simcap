> Upload this code and your Puck will advertise temperature (f), battery percentage, LED states, Voltage and Light data each minute. It will also advertise button, acceleration, magnetic field and nfc field state data when it senses a change. You can use EspruinoHub and NodeRed MQTT In nodes to record and process the advertised data.
