# SIMCAP | JOYPAD

`Status: Concept Stage`

A Web prototype of what should be a device applet advertising as a games console controller HID.

## The Goal

Pair 2 SIMCAP PALM devices (one on each hand) and emulate the use of a controller based on Baseline data eg: [GAMBIT](../GAMBIT/)

## Status

This component is currently in the concept stage. Implementation requires:

- Dual-device BLE coordination
- Game controller HID profile implementation
- Gesture-to-button mapping
- Sensor fusion from two independent IMUs
